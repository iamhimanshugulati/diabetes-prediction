# Diabetes Prediction

The following repository deals with the notebook of Diabetes Prediction and built a predictive system with help of **SVM(Support Vector Machine) Classifier**.

**Support Vector Machine** are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.

## Why SVM?

In given dataset there are 768 rows that is very less data and SVM give good result even in less amount data.

## Why Classifier

As in given dataset there is 'outcome' column and gives two value 0 and 1. 
Where 0 stand for Non-Diabetes and 1 stand for Diabetes, so there will be only two outcomes so we're using classifier of SVM.
